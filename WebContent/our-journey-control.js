Not to mention I was glow-in-the-dark pale. My poor skin needed some sunshine! </p><p> Trying to pick the perfect island in Greece to visit is like looking for a needle in a haystack. With 1,400 to chose from, I could only start researching for about 5 minutes before my ADD kicked in and my head wanted to explode.

This was probably my main reason for stopping over in Bali, and after doing some research I settled on Amed as my first dive spot. I knew I was going to tug on a wetsuit and jump in as many days as I could on the trip. With easy to access dive sites, calm currents and awesome reefs, this was going to be a great place to improve. </p> <p> After doing some research on Tripadvisor, I settled on Adventure Divers Bali, and wandered into their shop/homestay as soon as I arrived in Amed. They blew me away. I signed up for 4 dives over 2 days, and couldn’t have been happier. </p>"});

As soon as I read about Hydra last summer, I knew I had to make it a stop on my itinerary through Greece, and I wasn’t disappointed!</p> <p> When there are so many islands to chose from to visit in Greece, for me at least, it was hard to pinpoint down which ones to visit. Two important things about Hydra struck me, and as fate would have it, they were the two things I loved most about the island. </p> <p> Prepare to be shocked. </p>"});

And no, I’m not getting deported from New Zealand as I originally feared, rather I am embarking on an awesome new adventure in Tropical North Queensland, one of my favorite regions!I can’t wait!</p> <p> But more on that later, while I have been getting ready I found myself reminiscing about the first time I was in the Whitsundays, and I realized I haven’t even told the full story of my favorite activity on my blog. For shame! </p>"});

While more often than not when I am in Australia, I am in Queensland, an area that I love and know pretty well, so I was really excited this time around when I got the chance to check out Byron Bay for the first time with Canon.</p>"});
